i want to build a PPO model that:
Detects different types of impacts (bird, wind gust, wall collision)
Classifies the impact type and Recovers with appropriate stabilization strategies
and Works in both AirSim simulation and real hardware (MPU6050)


This is my PhD project, i need to find a reliable and trusted source from existing study that
recognize Different Types of Impact, Impact Signatures (Sensor Patterns) since each impact type creates a unique "signature" in sensor data.
The panel will ask where i obtain this information, therefore exisiting study will help to support this.
